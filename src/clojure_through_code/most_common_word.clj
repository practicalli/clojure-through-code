(ns clojure-through-code.most-common-word
  (:require
    [clojure.string]))


;; Algorithm
;; * Use regular expression to create a collection of individual words
;; * Convert all the words to lower case (so they match with common words source)
;; * Remove the common English words used in the book, leaving more context specific words
;; * Calculate the requencies of the remaining words, returning a map of word & word count pairs
;; * Sort the map by word count values
;; * Reverse the collection so the most commonly used word is the first element in the map

;; To understand what each of the functions do in the most-common-words function you can comment out one or more expressions by placing the comment reader macro #_ in front of the expression

(defn most-common-words

  (->> book
       #_(re-seq #"[a-zA-Z0-9|']+")

       #_frequencies
       #_(sort-by val)
       #_reverse))


;; Now the most-common-words function will only return the result of evaluating book (the full text of the book). To see what each of the other lines do, simply remove the #_ character from the front of an expression and re-evaluate the most-common-words function in the repl
