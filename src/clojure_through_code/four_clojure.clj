;; #18 - Sequences: filter
;;
;; Difficulty:	Elementary

;; Description
;; The filter function takes two arguments: a predicate function (f) and a sequence (s). Filter returns a new sequence consisting of all the items of s for which (f item) returns true.

;; Tests
(=  (filter #(> % 5) '(3 4 5 6 7)))


;; Analysis of the problem
;; filter will return a collection of all the elements that match the predicate (function).
;; filter is another function that iterates over a collection and returns a collection of results.  In this sense filter is very much like the map function.

;; Clojuredocs.org: clojure.core/filter
;; Available since 1.0 (source)
;; (filter pred)
;; (filter pred coll)
;; Returns a lazy sequence of the items in coll for which (pred item) returns logical true. pred must be free of side-effects.
;; Returns a transducer when no collection is provided.


;; The simplest way to see what filter is doing is to run that part of the expression in the REPL.
(filter #(> % 5) '(3 4 5 6 7))


;; => (6 7)

;; So filter returns the values that return true when passed to the `#(> % 5)` function.  This function is called the predicate.

;; If we used the same predicate function with map instead of filter, we would get part of the answer
(map #(> % 5) '(3 4 5 6 7))


;; => (false false false true true)

;; In the source code of filter, we can see that each value of the collection is taken and the predicate function applied.
;; If the predicate function returns true, then the value is constructed into a list along with any other matching results
;; Additional matching results are evaluated in a loop via a function call to the filter function, using the rest of the values.

;; (let [f (first s) r (rest s)]
;;   (if (pred f)
;;     (cons f (filter pred r))
;;     (filter pred r)))


;; The remove function does the inverse (complement) of filter and returns the values that return false from the predicate function.
;; It is essentailly a wrapper around the filter function, using the complement function to invert the result of the predicate function results.
;; So if the predicate function returned true, then complement would change that to false (and false would be changed to true).

;; (defn remove
;;   ([pred] (filter (complement pred)))
;;   ([pred coll]
;;    (filter (complement pred) coll)))


;; Answer
[6 7] ; Code Golf Score: 4

;; The following would also be correct answers, although would give bigger golf scores

'(6 7) ; As we are treating the list as just data, then we need to quote the list to avoid the REPL calling a function called 6 which does not exist.

(quote (6 7))  ; is simply the long form of the above answer.

;; NOTE: In Clojure it is idiomatic to use Vectors rather than lists for data representation

;; Difficulty:	Easy

;; Write a function which returns the first X fibonacci numbers.

;; Tests
#_(= (__ 3) '(1 1 2))
#_(= (__ 6) '(1 1 2 3 5 8))
#_(= (__ 8) '(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21))


;; First though is that we want to generate a range of numbers

(range 1 6)


;; => (1 2 3 4 5)

;; Looking at the range source code does not help that much as range is just a wrapper for clojure.lang.Range which is a Java class.


;; Analyse the problem
;; Looking at the tests we see that all fibonacci sequences start with `1 1`.
;; To get the third value in the sequence we add the first numbers together.  This is specific to the third value in the sequence.
;; To get each new value in the sequence we add the last to values in the sequence together

;; The problem asks us to write a function, so lets start there.

;; The function takes the size of fibonacci sequence to generate as an argument
;; and creates a local name to represent the initial fibonacci sequence.
;; Test to see if the fibonacci sequence is big enough and iterate if its too small.
(fn [size]
  (let [initial-sequence [1 1]]
    (if (< (count initial-sequence) size)
      "iterate"
      initial-sequence)))


;; Now we just need to iterate until we get a big enough fibonacci sequence
;; A simple way to iterate is to use loop recur, as we only only pass the size of fibonacci to generate as an argument to the function we are writing.
;; In each iteration we conjoin the result of adding all the values in the fib sequence together.
(fn fibs
  [size]
  (loop [fib [1 1]]
    (if (< (count fib) size)
      (recur (conj fib (reduce + fib)))
      fib)))


;; Test our function, generating a fibonacci sequence of size 3
((fn fibs
   [size]
   (loop [fib [1 1]]
     (if (< (count fib) size)
       (recur (conj fib (reduce + fib)))
       fib)))
 3)


;; => [1 1 2]

;; Test our function, generating a fibonacci sequence of size 6
((fn fibs
   [size]
   (loop [fib [1 1]]
     (if (< (count fib) size)
       (recur (conj fib (reduce + fib)))
       fib)))
 6)


;; => [1 1 2 4 8 16]
;; Although this generate a sequence of the right size, it is not the fibonacci sequence.
;; We need to add the last two values in the current sequence for each iteration

;; Change our recur to take the last and second to last values from the current value of fib.
;; As there is no second-last function, we reverse the sequence and take the second value.
(fn fibs
  [size]
  (loop [fib [1 1]]
    (if (< (count fib) size)
      (recur (conj fib (+ (second (reverse fib)) (last fib))))
      fib)))


((fn fibs
   [size]
   (loop [fib [1 1]]
     (if (< (count fib) size)
       (recur (conj fib (+ (second (reverse fib)) (last fib))))
       fib)))
 8)


;; => [1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21]

;; Code Golf Score: 101


;; NOTE: use a fibonacci sequence to draw a spiral using SVG for the clojurebridge exercises


;; Other solutions of note
;; There was one cheeky answer that caught my eye.  It does meet the current requirements of this problem very simply and is a way to codify your understanding of what result needs to be generated.

;; _pcl's solution:
;; TDD principle: Write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass :)
(fn [i] (take i '(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21)))


;; Obviously as soon as the requirements change to be a larger number than 8 for the fibonacci sequence, then this code is going to fail.


;; Write a function which behaves like reduce, but returns each intermediate value of the reduction.
;; Your function must accept either two or three arguments, and the return sequence must be lazy.

;; problem 73 - analyse tic-tac-toe board

;; A tic-tac-toe board is represented by a two dimensional vector. X is represented by :x, O is represented by :o, and empty is represented by :e.
;; A player wins by placing three Xs or three Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
;; Write a function which analyzes a tic-tac-toe board and returns :x if X has won, :o if O has won, and nil if neither player has won.


;; Define some tic-tac-toe board pattern to test

(def board-empty

   [:e :e :e]

;; Algorithm
;; 1) Extract all the values from the board  (destructuring with let)
;; 2) Pattern match the values to winning combinations (=)
;; 3) If any combination matched with :x or :o then return winner (or)


;; Destructuring will bind a local name to a value from the board pattern.
;; In this case, a b and c will each represent a line of the board

(let [[a b c] board-empty]
  [a b c])


;; => [[:e :e :e] [:e :e :e] [:e :e :e]]

;; Now a b and c will represent the elements of the first row of the board pattern.

(letfn* [winner (fn winner [[[a b c] [d e f] [g h i]] player])])

;; #80 Perfect numbers

;; Description

;; Add all the numbers that are divisors to get a total
;; Test if total and number being tested are equal


;; Passing the first test

;; Put simply, we can add the range of numbers that we know are the divisors,
;; then compare them with the potential perfect number.
(= (+ 1 2 3) 6)


;; => true

;; This expression also works for the second test
(= (+ 1 2 3) 7)


;; => false

;; So far we have just hard-coded the range of divisors, which we knew in advance.
;; Very few of us just know the range of divisors for numbers as large as 496.  So we need a way to calculate the divisors


;; Lets start with the first test case again, as its easy for us to check we are getting the right result.

;; The `range` function generates a range of interger values
;; We can specify a start point (zero by default)
;; The end of the range is around the half of the perfect number

;; So we can generate the whole range of numbers from 1 to 6
(range 1 6)


;; or just the range from 1 to half way
(range 1 3)


;; => (1 2)

;; Range is exclusive of the last number, so it stops before it gets 3.  However, if we use one number higher, then we get the right results.
(range 1 4)


;; => (1 2 3)

;; We can get the half way point by dividing the perfect number by 2
(range 1 (/ 6 2))


;; => (1 2)


;; although we have to add 1 to the result of dividing the perfect number by 2
(range 1 (+ 1 (/ 6 2)))


;; => (1 2 3)

(range 1 (/ 7 2))


;; => (1 2 3)

(range 1 3.5)


;; => (1 2 3)

;; The quot function returns the number of times one number goes into another.  Any remainder is discarded.
(quot 6 2)

;; Passes test as we are expecting false
((fn [number]

;; Using a larger number that is perfect fails the test though
((fn [number]
   (= number
      (reduce + ((fn [number] (range 1 (+ 1 (quot number 2)))) number)))) 496)


;; => false

;; So what is going on?  Lets take a look at what is happening inside this expression.

;; If we see the total number of all the numbers in the range we see that number is far higher than the perfect number.

        ((fn [number] (range 1 (+ 1 (quot number 2)))) 496))


;; => (1 2 4 8 16 31 62 124 248)

;; Adding this filter to our expression should now pass the test for any number
(fn [number]

;; alternative - use ratio? as the filter function to remove all numbers that are not an integer value

;; If we use the divide function on our perfect number then we will get a ratio type for each number in the range that does not divide equally

;; For example
(/ 496 37)


;; => 496/37

;; So we could use a filter that checks if the result is a ratio

(filter #(ratio? (/ 496 %))
        ((fn [number] (range 1 (+ 1 (quot number 2)))) 496))

;; filter generates all the numbers from the range that are ratio? types, so we want the inverse of this.
;; We could use not

(filter #(not (ratio? (/ 496 %)))
        ((fn [number] (range 1 (+ 1 (quot number 2)))) 496))


;; => (1 2 4 8 16 31 62 124 248)


;; Or we can use the a function that does the inverse of filter, a function called remove
(remove #(ratio? (/ 496 %))
        ((fn [number] (range 1 (+ 1 (quot number 2)))) 496))


;; => (1 2 4 8 16 31 62 124 248)


;; Further thoughts
;; Unless we need to optimise the processing of the range of numbers, we can just generate the whole range with a simpler expression
;; (range 1 number) instead of (range 1 (+ 1 (quot number 2)))

;; With a lazy sequence, we can still be fairly optimal in the way we work as the filter or remove function could be used to minimise the range being generated
