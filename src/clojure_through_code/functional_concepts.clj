;; ---------------------------------------
;; Clojure: anonymous functions

;; Define an anonymous in the general form as follows:

(fn [arguments] (str "some behaviour, typically using the aguments passed:" arguments))


;; To get a value from evaluating this function you need to pass it a value (or anonther function) as an argument as well as calling it as a function

((fn [arguments] (str "behaviour, typically using the aguments passed: " arguments)) "Is this the right room for an argument")


;; => "behaviour, typically using the aguments passed: Is this the right room for an argument"

;; TODO: add a more realistic use of anonymous fuctions

;; syntactic sugar for anonymous functions

;; In this example we use an anonymous function to add two numbers together

#(+ 1 2)


;; this just returns a pointer to the function.  To get the result we need to call this function as follows

(#(+ 1 2))


;; we can also pass arguments into anonymous functions

(#(inc %) 1)


;; the % is a placeholder for the argument and the argument is the value directly after the anonymous function.

;; Specific arguments can be refered to by using %1, %2, etc
;; sometimes position can be important as the following two versions of code demonstrate

(#(/ %1 %2) 24 6)

(#(/ %2 %1) 24 6)


;; These two expressions give different values (and return different types, Integer and Ratio) as the positions of the arguments have been reversed.

;; A simple idiom is using keywords for keys in a map

(/  22 7.0)
(double (/ 22 7))
(float (/ 22 7))


;; The range function returns a lazy sequence of numbers in the range given by the arguents provided to range.
;; Calling the range function without arguments will force an infinate sequence of numbers to be generated, quickly resulting in an out of memory error in the heap.

;; (range) ;; dont run range without arguments unless you put another constraint around it

;; Instead, we can either pass arguments to the range function that limit the sequence size or wrap the range function in another function

;; Pattern matching

;; Pattern mantching example

;; The classic fizzbuzz game were you substitute any number cleanly divisible by 3 with fix and any number cleanly divisible by 5 with buzz.
;; If the number is cleanly divisible by 3 & 5 then substitute fizzbuzz.

;; Include the library that has the match function

(require '[clojure.core.match :refer [match]])


(defn fizzbuzz
  [number]
  (match [(mod number 3) (mod number 5)]
    [0 0] :fizzbuzz
    [0 _] :fizz
    [_ 0] :buzz
    :else number))


;; This is an example of a simple pattern matching problem.

;; First we calculate the modulus of the number given as an argument by 3 then the same number by 5.
;; If the modulus value is 0 then the number is divisible exactly without remainder.
;; The result of these two function calls are the elements of a vector (an array-like strucutre)
;;
;; Using the require function we include the match function from the library clojure/core.match
;; https://github.com/clojure/core.match
;; (match may seem similar to a case statement from other languages).
;; We use match to compare the two results returned from the modulus functions.

;; There are 3 possible patterns to match against, each returns the appropriate value (fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz)
;; If there is no match, then the original number is returned.
;; The underscore character, _, means that any number will match in that position.

;; If you would like to try this out in the REPL, dont forget to include this namespace if you are not currently in it
;; (require '[clojure-through-code.live-demo :refer :all])

;; Now we can call fizbuzz for a specfic number

(fizzbuzz 1)
(fizzbuzz 3)
(fizzbuzz 4)
(fizzbuzz 15)


;; If we want to convert a sequence of numbers, then we can call fizzbuzz over a collection (eg, a vector) of numbers
;; using the map function

(map fizzbuzz [1 2 3 4 5])


;; We can make a function called play-fizzbuzz to make it easy to use
;; The function takes the highest number in the range and generates all the numbers from 0 to that number.
;; Finally, we convert the results into strings
(defn play-fizbuzz
  [max-number]
  (->> (range max-number)

;; clojure.core/->
;; -> is the thread first macro. It transforms code from a linear notation into nested notation. This is also known as âfunction chainingâ. Clojure calls this âthreadingâ.

;; (as-> expr name form1 form2 form3 â¦)
;; evaluate each form in turn, such that in form1 the name has value of expr, and in form2 the name has the value of form1's result, etc. Returns the result of the last form.

;; In this example, first the value 4 is bound to the name x.  Then the first expression is evaluated, returning 4.  This result is passed to the nested expression, so its x name becomes bound to the value 4.  Finaly we return the result of evaluating (list 3 4)

(as-> 4 x (list 3 x))

(as-> "a" x     ; first bind the value "a" to the name x and pass on the result to the next expression

;; => Wrong number of args (1) passed to: functional-concepts/sum

;; If we did need to call sum with fewer than the required arguments, for example if we are mapping sum over a vector, then we can use partial to help us call the sum function with the right number of arguments.

;; Lets add the value 2 to each element in our collection
(map (partial sum 2) [1 3 5 7 9])

;; currying in clojure

;; Currying is the process of taking some function that accepts multiple arguments, and turning it into a sequence of functions, each accepting a single argument.  Or put another way, to transform a function with multiple arguments into a chain of single-argument functions.

;; currying relies on having fixed argument sizes, whereas Clojure gets a lot of flexibility from variable argument lengths (variable arity).

;; Clojure therefore has the partial function gives results similar to currying, however the partical function also works with variable functions.

;; Partial refers to supplying some number of arguments to a function, and getting back a new function that takes the rest of the arguments and returns the final result

;; Once advantage of partial is to avoid having to write your own anonymous functions

;; ## Loop & Recur

;; There are also `loop` and `recur` functions in Clojure that can be used for control flow, however they are considered low level operations and higher order functions are typically used.

;; A common patter is to create a sequence of values (characters in a string, values in a map, vector, set or list) and apply one or more of clojure's sequence functions (doseq, dorun, take-while, etc.)

;; The following example reads the first username from /etc/passwd on unix like systems.

;; ```clojure
(require '[clojure.java [io :as io]])


(defn char-seq
  "create a lazy sequence of characters from an input stream"
  [i-stream]
  (map char
       (take-while
         (partial not= -1)
         (repeatedly #(.read i-stream)))))


;; process the sequence one token at a time
;; with-open will automatically close the stream for us

(with-open [is (io/input-stream "/etc/passwd")]
  (doseq [c (take-while (partial not= \:) (char-seq is))]
    ;; your processing is done here
    (prn c)))


;; ```
