;; could define a data structure, large enough for any series length you want
(def fibonachi-data #{1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 223})


;; The evaluation of the set is not ordered, so use a function to create a sorted output
;; We can sort in accending < order, or decending > order
(sorted-set-by > 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 223)


;; We can of course also create an ordered set to start with and give it a name,
;; so when we refer to the set by name it always gives us an ordered set

;; Rather than generate a long set of numbers, we can use lazy evaluation to generate just the series we need each time.
;; Clojure is very good at generating data structures and only calculating the part of the data structure needed at that time

;; From stack exchange

;; initial solution

;; (defn fib [x, n]
;;   (if (< (count x) n)
;;     (fib (conj x (+ (last x) (nth x (- (count x) 2)))) n)
;;     x))

;; To use this I need to seed x with [0 1] when calling the function. My question is, without wrapping it in a separate function, is it possible to write a single function that only takes the number of elements to return?

;; Doing some reading around led me to some better ways of achieving the same funcionality:

;; (defn fib2 [n]
;;   (loop [ x [0 1]]
;;     (if (< (count x) n)
;;       (recur (conj x (+ (last x) (nth x (- (count x) 2)))))
;;       x)))

;; and

;; (defn fib3 [n]
;;   (take n
;;     (map first (iterate (fn [[a b]] [b (+ a b)]) [0 1]))))

;; Multi-arity approach

;; (defn fib
;;   ([n]
;;      (fib [0 1] n))
;;   ([x, n]
;;      (if (< (count x) n)
;;        (fib (conj x (+ (last x) (nth x (- (count x) 2)))) n)
;;        x)))


;; Thrush operator

;; You can use the thrush operator to clean up #3 a bit (depending on who you ask; some people love this style, some hate it; I'm just pointing out it's an option):

;; (defn fib [n]
;;   (->> [0 1]
;;     (iterate (fn [[a b]] [b (+ a b)]))
;;     (map first)
;;     (take n)))
;; That said, I'd probably extract the (take n) and just have the fib function be a lazy infinite sequence.

;; (defn fib
;;   (->> [0 1]
;;     (iterate (fn [[a b]] [b (+ a b)]))
;;     (map first)))

;; ;;usage
;; (take 10 fib)
;; ;;output (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34)


;; Avoiding recursion ?

;; In Clojure it's actually advisable to avoid recursion and instead use the loop and recur special forms.
;; This turns what looks like a recursive process into an iterative one, avoiding stack overflows and
;; improving performance.

;; Here's an example of how you'd implement a Fibonacci sequence with this technique:

;; (defn fib [n]
;;   (loop [fib-nums [0 1]]
;;     (if (>= (count fib-nums) n)
;;       (subvec fib-nums 0 n)
;;       (let [[n1 n2] (reverse fib-nums)]
;;         (recur (conj fib-nums (+ n1 n2)))))))

;; The loop construct takes a series of bindings, which provide initial values, and one or more body forms.
;; In any of these body forms, a call to recur will cause the loop to be called recursively with the
;; provided arguments.
