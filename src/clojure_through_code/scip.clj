(defn pascal
  [n]
  (take n (iterate #(mapv (fn [[x y]] (+ x y))
                          (partition 2 1 (cons 0 (into % [0])))) [1])))


;; For a given row, if you prepend and append 0 and then break into (overlapping) pairs, then add each pair, you get the next rows.
;; So you can have an infinite sequence of Pascal's triangle rows and you just take as many rows as you want.

;; You could safely use (concat [0] % [0]) instead of (cons 0 (into % [0])) if you find that clearer -- mapv is eager so you won't get a stack overflow from a lazy computation.

;; concat (is more forgiving about) doesn't have subtle bug possibilities via seq / vector conj location (edited)
