;; Creating data structures in Clojure

(ns clojure-through-code.02-data-structures)


;; Clojure has several data structures as part of the language,
;; list (a linked list),
;; vector (indexed access like an array),
;; map (key / Value pairs, usually using clojure :keyword type for the keys,
;; set (unique elements, not ,ordered by default).
;; These data structures are typically used rather than defining your own types
;; Thise 4 data structures are extremely efficient immutable data structures.

;; You can also consider strings as collections to and use them in similar ways to the other built in collections.


;;
;; Strings


;; Strings act as a collection of characters, so you can use the functions typically used for other collections - first, second, rest. last.

(first "Clojure")


;; => \C

(second "Clojure")


;; => \l

(rest "Clojure")


;; => (\l \o \j \u \r \e)

;; The rest function returns a collection of the remaining characters after the first one.  This collection is in a list.  If you wish to return the rest of the characters as a string instead, you can apply the str function over the result of calling rest on the string.

(apply str (rest "Clojure"))


;; => "lojure"

(last "Clojure")


;; => \e

;; The get function can also be used to return values at a specific position in the string (index).  Like arrays (vectors in Clojure) strings are indexed from 0 onwards.  So the first character in the string is at position 0.

(get "Clojure" 3)


;; => \j


;; Note:  Clojure also has built in regular expressions which is useful for finding strings, sub-strings and filtering text.
;; See the section on regular expressions (TODO)

;;
;; Clojure persistent data structures


;; list ()
;; a general set of elements with a sequential lookup time

;; you can use the list function to create a new list
(list 1 2 3 4)
(list -1 -0.234 0 1.3 8/5 3.1415926)
(list "cat" "dog" "rabit" "fish" 12 22/7)


;; you can use any "types" in your list or any other Clojure collection
(list :cat :dog :rabit :fish)


;; you can mix types because Clojure is dynamic and it will work it out later,
;; you can even have functions as elements, because functions always return a value
(list :cat 1 "fish" 22/7 (str "fish" "n" "chips"))


;; further examples of mixing types

(list)
(list 1 2 3 4)

(def five 5)  ; bind the name five to the value 5, clojure's equivalent to assignment

(list 1 2 "three" [4] five '(6 7 8 9))


;; (1 2 3 4) ;; This list causes an error when evaluated

'(1 2 3 4)

(quote (1 2 3 4))


;; one unique thing about lists is that the first element is always evaluated as a function call,
;; with the remaining elements as arguments.

;; So, defining a list just using () will cause an error

;; This list definition will fail, unless you have defined a function called 1
;; ( 1 2 3 4)

;; There is a special function called quote that tells Clojure to just treat the
;; list as data.

(quote (1 2 3 4))


;; This syntax is actually more code to type than (list 1 2 3 4),
;; so there is a shortcut for the quote function using the ' character

'(1 2 3 4)
'(-1 -0.234 0 1.3 8/5 3.1415926)
'("cat" "dog" "rabit" "fish")
'(:cat :dog :rabit :fish)
'(:cat 1 "fish" 22/7 (str "fish" "n" "chips"))


;; The quote shortcut is uses where ever you have a list that you want to treat just as data.
;; Another example is when you are including functions from other namespaces
;; (ns my-namespace.core
;;  use 'my-namespace.library)


;; Duplicate elements in a list ?

(list 1 2 3 4 1)
(list "one" "two" "one")
(list :fred :barney :fred)


;; Sets #{}

;; #{1 2 3 4 1}
;; duplicate key error

(set [1 2 3 4 1])


;; only returns unique set from the collection
(sorted-set 1 4 0 2 9 3 5 3 0 2 7 6 5 5 3 8)


;; Vector []
;; A vector looks like an array and is better for random access.
;; A vector has an index to look up elements at a specific point, speeding up random access
;; Vectors and maps are the most common data structures use to hold data in Clojure

;; you can use the vector function to create a new vector
(vector 1 2 3 4)


;; Usually you just use the [] notation to create a vector to help keep your code readable
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2.4 3.1435893 11/4 5.0 6 7]
[:cat :dog :rabit :fish]
[:cat 1 "fish" 22/7 (str "fish" "n" "chips")]
[]


;; You can also put other data structures in vectors, in this example a list is an element of the vector
[1 2 3 '(4 5 6)]


;; remember we defined five earlier in the code
[1 2 3 4 (list five)]


;; Duplicate elements ?
[1 2 3 4 1]


;; Map {}
;; A key / value pair data structure
;; keys are usually defined as a :keyword, although they can be anything

;; Typicall a :keyword is used for a the key in a map, with the value being
;; a string, number or another keyword
{:key "value"}
(:key 42)
{:key symbol}
{:key :value}
{"key" "value"}


;; As with other collections, you can use anything as a key or a value,
;; they are all values underneath.
{:key 42}
{"key" "value"}


{:a 1 :b 2 :c 3}


;; Define a simple shopping list, including how many of each items you want to buy
(def shopping-list
  {"cat food"  10
   "soya milk" 4
   "bread"     1
   "cheese"    2})


;; ASCII code generator
;;
;; Defining ascii codes in a collection
;; Create an ascii code generator for an alphabet

;; Simple definition of ascii codes using a map.
(def ascii-codes
  {65 "a" 66 "b" 67 "c"})


(get ascii-codes 65)


;; => "a"


;; We want to convert an alphabet, which could be defined as follows
(def english-alphabet
  ["a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"])


;; Or if we are give an alphabet in a single string, then we can create a more suitable colllection
(clojure.string/split "a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z" #" ")


;; => ["a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"]


;; Lets generate a hash-map of ascii codes for a given alphabet.
;; Lower case a is ascii code 65, so that will be our starting code value.
;; Using the map function we can take an element from each collection,
;; the alphabet and a generated range of numbers, and combine them in pairs.
;; The pairs are placed into a hashmap
;; The generated ascii codes are a generate range between the start code and the start code plus the number of letters in the alphabet.
(defn generate-ascii-codes
  [alphabet code-start]
  (map hash-map
       alphabet
       (range 65 (+ code-start (count english-alphabet)))))


(generate-ascii-codes english-alphabet 65)


;; Its also quite common to have maps made up of other maps

;; Here is an example of a map made up of a :keyword as the key and
;; a map as the value.  The map representing the value is itself
;; defined with :keywords and strings

{:starwars {:characters {:jedi   ["Luke Skywalker"
                                  "Obiwan Kenobi"]
                         :sith   ["Darth Vader"
                                  "Darth Sideous"]
                         :droids ["C3P0"
                                  "R2D2"
                                  "BB-8"]}
            :ships {:rebel-alliance  ["Millenium Falcon"
                                      "X-wing figher"]

                                      "Destroyer"
                                      "Im just making these up now"]}}}


;; => {:starwars {:characters {:jedi ["Luke Skywalker" "Obiwan Kenobi"], :sith ["Darth Vader" "Darth Sideous"], :droids ["C3P0" "R2D2" "BB-8"]}, :ships {:rebel-alliance ["Millenium Falcon" "X-wing figher"], :imperial-empire ["Intergalactic Cruser" "Destroyer" "Im just making these up now"]}}}



;; Individual starwars characters can be defined using a map of maps
{:luke   {:fullname "Luke Skywarker" :skill "Targeting Swamp Rats"}
 :vader  {:fullname "Darth Vader"    :skill "Crank phone calls"}
 :jarjar {:fullname "JarJar Binks"   :skill "Upsetting a generation of fans"}}


;; To make the starwars character information easier to use, lets give the collection of characters a name using the def function

(def starwars-characters
  {:luke   {:fullname "Luke Skywarker" :skill "Targeting Swamp Rats"}
   :vader  {:fullname "Darth Vader"    :skill "Crank phone calls"}
   :jarjar {:fullname "JarJar Binks"   :skill "Upsetting a generation of fans"}})


(get starwars-characters :luke)
(get (get starwars-characters :luke) :skill)
(get-in starwars-characters [:luke :fullname])

(:skill (:luke starwars-characters))


;; updating maps with assoc-in
(assoc-in starwars-characters [:vader :skill] "The Dark Side of the Force")


;; => {:luke {:fullname "Luke Skywarker", :skill "Targeting Swamp Rats"}, :vader {:fullname "Darth Vader", :skill "The Dark Side of the Force"}, :jarjar {:fullname "JarJar Binks", :skill "Upsetting a generation of fans"}}

(update)

(def alphabet-soup {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})

(assoc alphabet-soup :d 4)


;; => {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3, :d 4}

(update alphabet-soup :a inc)


;; => {:a 2, :b 2, :c 3}


;; Now we can refer to the characters using keywords

;; Using the get function we return all the informatoin about Luke
(get starwars-characters :luke)


;; By wrapping the get function around our first, we can get a specific
;; piece of information about Luke
(get (get starwars-characters :luke) :fullname)


;; There is also the get-in function that makes the syntax a little easier to read
(get-in starwars-characters [:luke :fullname])
(get-in starwars-characters [:vader :fullname])


;; Or you can get really Clojurey by just talking to the map directly
(starwars-characters :luke)
(:fullname (:luke starwars-characters))
(:skill (:luke starwars-characters))

(starwars-characters :vader)
(:skill (:vader starwars-characters))
(:fullname (:vader starwars-characters))


;; And finally we can also use the threading macro to minimise our code further

(-> starwars-characters
    :luke)


(-> starwars-characters
    :luke
    :fullname)


(-> starwars-characters
    :luke
    :skill)

;; Duplicate keys in a map are not allowed, so the following maps...

;; {"fish" "battered" "chips" "fried" "fish" "battered and fried"}
;; {:fish "battered" :chips "fried" :fish "battered & fried"}

;; ...throw dupicate key errors

;; Duplicate values are okay though
{"fish" "battered" "chips" "fried" "cod" "fried"}


;; What is the difference between Collections & Sequences
;;

;; Vectors and Lists are java classes too!
(class [1 2 3])
(class '(1 2 3))


;; A list would be written as just (1 2 3), but we have to quote
;; it to stop the reader thinking it's a function.
;; Also, (list 1 2 3) is the same as '(1 2 3)

;; Both lists and vectors are collections:
(coll? '(1 2 3)) ; => true
(coll? [1 2 3]) ; => true

;; Only lists are seqs.
(seq? '(1 2 3)) ; => true
(seq? [1 2 3]) ; => false



;;
;; Generating Data

(take 20 (cycle ["foo" "bar"]))


;; Conjoining collections together

(conj {:a 1} '(:b 2))

(cons {:a 1} (map inc '(1 2)))

(conj {:a 1} (map inc '(1 2)))


(conj)


;; => []

;; why do we get a class cast error when we try to conj a list into a map,
;; however we can conj a map and a vector
