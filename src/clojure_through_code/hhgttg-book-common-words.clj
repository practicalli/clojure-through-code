;; Algorithm
;; * Use regular expression to create a collection of individual words
;; * Convert all the words to lower case (so they match with common words source)
;; * Remove the common English words used in the book, leaving more context specific words
;; * Calculate the requencies of the remaining words, returning a map of word & word count pairs
;; * Sort the map by word count values
;; * Reverse the collection so the most commonly used word is the first element in the map


;; TODO: Create a transducers version of the above code
